# Blazor-Shared-UI
A shared UI between Blazor Web and Hybrid which is not just components but full web pages and other functionality

This is a template project with some example pages to help get you started on your next hybrid Blazor Web and Application Project. This is designed to use both frameworks at the same time pulling from one source, that does mean you will have to modify the base Web and Desktop projects to be aware of certain files in the Base project.

## Pages
These are the core of what this app is meant for. Giving you the ability to share pages across the two apps. Simply add a new page in the Base project under the pages folder. Make sure you includes the @pages at the top of the .razor file and it should work right away in this template project.
